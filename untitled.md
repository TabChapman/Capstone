I have decided to go with the lyrics project. I will use song lyrics to build a multiclass classification model that predicts the author of the song lyrics in order to learn about different lyricism of singers. I chose this because I think it would be easier to find data. I am using the genus API to find the lyrics. Luckily I found a python wrapper that does a lot of the web strapping already. I still need to fool around with it some more to find out how it works. Not exacualy sure what subset of the data I'm ultimetly going to build the model on. Probably top 10 songs of top 100 selling artists.
