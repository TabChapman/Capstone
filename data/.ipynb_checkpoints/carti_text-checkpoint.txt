Where my Carti fans at?
One of the most loyal, most dedicated fanbases I've seen in a while
They wait patiently, patiently, patiently, patiently
I had to damn near sell my soul for this information
The Illuminati owns part of me
What I also found out, Kanye West is the executive producer
Along with Matthew Williams who work at Givenchy
So maybe that will make sense, some of the pictures he been posting recently
That's reason why he said he got a gift for y'all
Nigga, he's Santa
That's the gift, nigga
Okay? This year been horrible
And to be honest, from what I'm hearing
Expect a classic (Yeah)

I only want the best for you (What? What?)
I cure your love like a doctor
Tell me what you want me to do (Woah, yeah)
Tell me what you want me to do (Slatt)
I can wear a business suit and speak proper (Proper)
Or I can put a hundred niggas on and buy them choppers (Choppers)
See, 'round my parts of town, that's how we get down (What?)
I'm from Fulton County, lil' bitch, that's no cap now (Yeah)
I went to school with some robbers and some killers
And half of them niggas dead or in jail, but fuck it, they my niggas (Yeah)

[Interlude: Playboi Carti]
Basically, what I'm saying is, I can't change, but
But for you, I would do things and
Maybe one day I'd get on my knees and give you a diamond ring, uh
All sorts of things, yeah (Yeah)
All sorts of things, yeah (Oh)
I'll sort some things out (Ooh)
You got me turnt out
