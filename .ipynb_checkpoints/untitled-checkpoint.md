I have decided to go with the lyrics project. I will use song lyrics to build a multiclass classification model that predicts the author of the song lyrics in order to learn about different lyricism of singers. I chose this because I think it would be easier to find data. I am using the genus API to find the lyrics. Luckily I found a python wrapper that does a lot of the web strapping already. I still need to fool around with it some more to find out how it works.
